The dataset encompasses an extensive collection of 395,056,566 pull requests across 11,230 unique project IDs, offering a robust foundation for detailed statistical scrutiny. In this analysis, small teams were delineated by a threshold established at the 33rd percentile of team sizes across all projects, with teams comprising up to 4 members classified as 'small.'

In this context, 4,866 projects met the criteria for small teams, contributing to a total of 53,627,224 pull requests. This notable volume highlights the active participation of small teams within the dataset. Among these, 1,847 projects were marked by global collaboration, characterized by the diverse geographical origins of contributors, while 3,019 were identified with non-global collaboration, indicating teams working within the same country.

The focal point of this analysis was to explore how variations in review speed—specifically, the time taken to respond to initial pull requests—might influence collaborative dynamics, as reflected by the volume of PR comments and the number of participants involved in the discussions. The derived correlation coefficients shed light on the potential impact of review speed on these dimensions of collaboration.

For small team projects engaged in global collaboration:

- The correlation coefficient of -0.0243 between review speed (first response time) and the number of PR comments reveals a marginally negative linear relationship. This suggests that faster review times are slightly associated with a reduced number of comments, albeit the connection is weak, indicating that rapid reviews might modestly diminish the depth of conversation in PR discussions.
- A correlation coefficient of -0.0495 between review speed and participant count indicates a similarly weak negative relationship, hinting that quicker reviews might be linked to engagements with fewer participants, possibly suggesting that expedited reviews could limit the scope of collaboration to a smaller group.

For projects characterized by non-global collaboration:

- A coefficient of -0.0136 between review speed and PR comments intimates a very weak negative association, implying that increased review speed may lead to a marginally lower volume of comments in the context of local collaboration.
- Similarly, the -0.0159 correlation between review speed and the number of participants is indicative of a slight negative relationship, suggesting that faster reviews are weakly associated with fewer participant engagements.

These insights infer that in small team projects, the speed of review may exert a subtle influence on collaborative engagement, as evidenced by the number of comments and participants, although the correlations are notably weak. This suggests that while faster review times might streamline or abbreviate the collaborative discourse to some degree, they do not markedly alter the fundamental patterns of interaction.
